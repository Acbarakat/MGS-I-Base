# MGS I Base
Multilevel Group Selection I (MGS I) simulates a social space composed of agents that either contribute prosocial common-pool behavior when in a group or not (i.e., freeride), and that are equally exposed to some (physical, psychological, and/or social) pressure to change their behavior. Exposure to prosocial common-pool behavior can help agents withstand the pressure, especially when the behavior is synergistic. Agents move within their social space to avoid this pressure, as a result forming into groups (common pools), which is where prosocial common-pool behavior can occur. Agents unable to withstand the pressure automatically change from contributing prosocial common-pool behavior to not or vice versa. We leave the empowerment of agents with the ability to choose their behavior for future (more complex) variants of this base model.
